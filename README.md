# hangman_terminal_game

Not only was this game an opprotunity to sharpen my javascript fundamentals. This was also an exploration in using various technologies to augment my own self learning.  To build this game I used the help of chatGPT in order to explore its effectiveness in guiding a simple project.  I also used google to search for solutions to a few problems I was facing.  I was able to find these solutions within sites like W3 Schools and Stack Overflow.

When we say something like, "I could do this on my own". I think we are really saying is "I could research how to do this on my own" or "At some point I have done enough research or learned from someone else and now I the skills to do this on my own".  

What I am trying to say is, no person is an island and at some point we are all reliant on each other in order to learn anything.

## Idea Generation

I first had GPT generate a list of possible games that I could build. 

This is the list it gave me:

1. Guess the Number: The computer generates a random number, and the player needs to guess it within a certain number of attempts. The game provides hints like "higher" or "lower" after each guess.

2. Hangman: The computer selects a word, and the player needs to guess it by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe: Build a two-player tic-tac-toe game where players take turns entering their moves in the terminal until there's a winner or a tie.

4. Blackjack: Create a simplified version of the popular card game Blackjack. The player plays against the computer dealer, aiming to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

5. Word Jumble: The game presents a jumbled word to the player, who needs to guess the original word. You can use an array of predefined words and randomly select one for each game.

6. Rock, Paper, Scissors: Implement the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the player competes against the computer. The game determines the winner based on the choices made by both players.

7. Mastermind: The computer generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colored pegs. The player needs to guess the code within a certain number of attempts, and the game provides feedback on the correctness of each guess.

8. Snake: Create a terminal version of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, and the objective is to avoid collision with the walls or the snake's own body.
