Javascript fundamentals practice

This is an exploration in using technologies to augment my own self learning.  To build this game I used the help of chatGPT in order to explore its effectiveness in guiding a simple project. 

When we say something like, "I could do this on my own". What we are really saying is "I could research how to do this on my own" or "At some point I have done enough research that gave me the skills to do this on my own".  What I am trying to say is, no person is an island and at some point we are all reliant on each other in order to learn anything. 

## Idea Generation

I first had GPT generate a list of possible games that I could build.
