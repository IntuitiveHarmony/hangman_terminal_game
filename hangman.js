// 1. Choose a word: Create an array of words from which the game will randomly select one. You can start with a small set of words and expand it later.

// 2. Set up the game loop: Create a loop that continues until the game is won or lost. This loop will handle each round of the game.

// 3. Display the initial state: At the start of each round, display the current state of the hidden word to the player. Initially, all letters are hidden and replaced with underscores or dashes.

// 4. Prompt for input: Ask the player to enter a letter guess. You can use the `readline` module in Node.js to read user input from the terminal.

// 5. Check the input: Validate the player's input to ensure it is a single letter. Handle cases where the player enters an invalid input (e.g., a number or multiple letters).

// 6. Update the game state: Determine if the guessed letter is correct and update the hidden word accordingly. Replace the corresponding underscores or dashes with the correct letter.

// 7. Track incorrect guesses: Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of incorrect guesses the player has made. Display the hangman figure corresponding to the number of incorrect guesses.

// 8. Check win/lose conditions: After each guess, check if the player has won or lost the game. The game is won if all letters have been correctly guessed. The game is lost if the player has made a certain number of incorrect guesses.

// 9. Display the result: After the game loop ends (either by winning or losing), display the result to the player. Show the correct word if the game is lost.

// 10. Prompt for a new game: Ask the player if they want to play again. If they agree, restart the game loop. If not, exit the program.

// These steps provide a high-level overview of the Hangman game's structure and flow. As you start implementing each step, you can break them down into smaller tasks and gradually build the game.
